# Human-robot-sign-language-Tutor

 The project is aimed to utilize humanoid robots for sign language tutoring. Humanoid robot Nao V6 as a subject is proposed to design the sign language tutoring program for sign language learner especially children. This will be accomplished by designing an interaction learning focused on visual communication, turn-taking, imitation, and developing specifically for robots and learner (children) to take part and give children a splendid chance to learn and quickly apply new signs. 


This project designed in two steps, first step is sign language recognition were we create a sign detector, which detects the alphabets that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the numbers from 1 to 10.
This is divided into 3 parts:
1.	Creating the dataset
2.	Training a CNN on the captured dataset
3.	Predicting the data

The requirements software & libraries for the sign language project are:

•	Python (3.7.4)

•	IDE (Jupyter)

•	Numpy (version 1.16.5)

•	cv2 (openCV) (version 3.4.2)

•	Keras (version 2.3.1)

•	Tensorflow (as keras uses tensorflow in backend and for image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0)
